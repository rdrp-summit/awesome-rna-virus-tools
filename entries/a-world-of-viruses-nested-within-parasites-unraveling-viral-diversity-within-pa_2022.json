  "description": "Little is known about the diversity of parasite-associated viruses and how these viruses may impact parasite fitness, parasite-host interactions, and virus evolution. The discovery of over a hundred viruses associated with a range of free-living and parasitic flatworms, including parasites of economic and clinical relevance, allowed us to compare the viromes of flatworms with contrasting lifestyles",
