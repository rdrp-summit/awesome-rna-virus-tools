  "description": "Ticks are widely distributed in pastoral areas in northwestern China and act as vectors that carry and transmit a variety of pathogens, especially viruses. Our study revealed the diversity of tick viruses in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia and uncovered the phylogenetic relationships of some RNA viruses, especially the important zoonotic tick-borne severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus in Inner Mongolia",
