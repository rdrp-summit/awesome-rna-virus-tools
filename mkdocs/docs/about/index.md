# About the RdRp Summit Community

The **RdRp Summit** is an open scientific community dedicated to advancing RNA virus research through improved computational tools, data interoperability, and collaborative science.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We are committed to fostering innovation and collaboration in RNA virus discovery and characterization by:

1. **Improving Data Interoperability** - Standardizing formats, protocols, and metadata to enable seamless data sharing
2. **Breaking Echo Chambers** - Facilitating collaboration across research groups and institutions
3. **Advancing Detection Methods** - Promoting discussion and comparison of viral discovery algorithms
4. **Ensuring Reproducibility** - Supporting open science practices and reproducible research workflows

### Research Areas
- RNA virus identification and classification
- Viral genome assembly and annotation
- Phylogenetic analysis and evolution
- Host-virus interactions
- Metagenomics and environmental virology

## 📅 Summit Events

### RdRp Summit 2023 - Valencia, Spain
Our inaugural summit brought together the global RNA virus research community for:
- Open discussion sessions on standardization challenges
- Technical presentations on cutting-edge detection algorithms
- Collaborative workshops on data interoperability
- Networking opportunities for early-career researchers

### RdRp Summit 2025 - Lisbon, Portugal
Held as a satellite event of ViBioM 2025, focusing on:
- Next-generation viral discovery platforms
- AI/ML applications in virology
- Community-driven tool development
- Future directions in viral genomics
