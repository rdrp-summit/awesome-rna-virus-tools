# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Awesome RNA Virus Tools collection! This guide will help you understand how to add new tools, improve existing entries, and contribute to the community.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Adding a New Tool

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a new JSON file** in the `entries/` directory
3. **Follow the schema** defined in `scripts/schema.json`
4. **Test your entry** by running the validation scripts
5. **Submit a pull request** with your changes

### Example Entry

```json
{
  "name": "YourToolName",
  "url": "https://github.com/username/your-tool",
  "doi": "10.1000/example.doi",
  "description": "Brief description of what your tool does",
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "language": "Python",
  "topics": ["rna-virus-identification", "metagenomics"],
  "package_managers": ["pip", "conda"],
  "platforms": ["linux", "macos", "windows"],
  "installation_methods": ["source", "binary"]
}
```

## üìã Entry Requirements

### Required Fields
- **name**: Tool name
- **url**: Homepage or repository URL
- **description**: Clear, concise description (1-2 sentences)
- **topics**: At least one topic from the approved list

### Recommended Fields
- **doi**: Publication DOI if available
- **license**: Software license
- **language**: Primary programming language
- **package_managers**: Installation methods (pip, conda, etc.)
- **platforms**: Supported operating systems
- **version**: Latest version number
- **date**: Publication or release date

### Optional Fields
- **bibtex**: Full citation in BibTeX format
- **input_formats**: Supported input file formats
- **output_formats**: Generated output formats
- **installation_methods**: Installation approaches

## üè∑Ô∏è Topic Categories

Use these standardized topics to categorize your tool:

- **rna-virus-identification**: General RNA virus detection
- **rdrp-detection**: RdRp-specific detection tools
- **genome-assembly**: Viral genome assembly
- **annotation**: Genome annotation and gene prediction
- **phylogenetics**: Phylogenetic analysis tools
- **host-prediction**: Host-virus interaction prediction
- **databases**: Sequence databases and resources

## üîç Quality Standards

### Tool Inclusion Criteria

‚úÖ **Include tools that:**
- Are actively maintained or widely used
- Have clear documentation
- Are relevant to RNA virus research
- Are publicly available
- Have been published or are in preprint

‚ùå **Avoid tools that:**
- Are no longer maintained (unless historically significant)
- Lack documentation
- Are proprietary without academic access
- Are duplicates of existing entries
- Are too general (not virus-specific)

### Description Guidelines

- **Be concise**: 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Be specific**: Mention key features or use cases
- **Avoid jargon**: Use accessible language
- **Include context**: Mention the type of analysis or data

**Good examples:**
- "Deep learning method for identifying viral sequences from metagenomic data"
- "Specialized assembler for coronavirus genomes with improved handling of repetitive regions"

**Avoid:**
- "Great tool for virus stuff"
- "The best assembler ever made"
- "Tool that does many things"

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Local Testing

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r mkdocs/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Validate your entry:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_entries.py
   ```

3. **Generate documentation:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/update_docs.py
   ```

4. **Test the site locally:**
   ```bash
   cd mkdocs && mkdocs serve
   ```

### File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `tool-name.json`
- Match the tool name: `virsorter2.json`
- Avoid spaces and special characters

### JSON Formatting

- Use 2-space indentation
- Sort fields alphabetically (optional but preferred)
- Validate JSON syntax before submitting
